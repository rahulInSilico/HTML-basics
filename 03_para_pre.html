<body>

	<p>
	This is a paragraph tag. It is used to display normal text content
	on a webpage. The browser automatically adds spacing before and
	after a paragraph.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Multiple spaces and line breaks written inside a paragraph tag
	are ignored by the browser.
	</p>

	<pre>
	This is preformatted text.
	Line breaks
	and spaces
	are preserved exactly as written.
	</pre>

</body>
</html>
	
	<!--
	Notes:
	- <p> is used for normal text content
	- Extra spaces and line breaks are ignored inside <p>
	- <pre> preserves spaces and line breaks
	- <pre> is useful for code blocks and formatted text
